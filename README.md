# Union hospital prices

> An analysis of price discrepancies at Union Hospital in Terre Haute, IN.

I was inspired by [this NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/22/upshot/hospital-prices.html) to look at the prices for medical procedures at my local hospital to see if I could find any discrepancies or inconsistencies.

The data I used is included in this repo as an Excel spreadsheet. But it is also posted publicly [here](https://www.myunionhealth.org/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/billing-and-insurance/online-estimate/).
